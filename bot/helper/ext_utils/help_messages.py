Use this format to add feed url:
Title1 link (required)
Title2 link -c cmd -inf xx -exf xx
Title3 link -c cmd -d ratio:time -z password

-c command -up mrcc:remote:path/subdir -rcf --buffer-size:8M|key|key:value
-inf For included words filter.
-exf For excluded words filter.
-stv true or false (sensitive filter)

Example: Title https://www.rss-url.com -inf 1080 or 720 or 144p|mkv or mp4|hevc -exf flv or web|xxx
This filter will parse links that its titles contain `(1080 or 720 or 144p) and (mkv or mp4) and hevc` and doesn't contain (flv or web) and xxx words. You can add whatever you want.

Another example: -inf  1080  or 720p|.web. or .webrip.|hvec or x264. This will parse titles that contain ( 1080  or 720p) and (.web. or .webrip.) and (hvec or x264). I have added space before and after 1080 to avoid wrong matching. If this `10805695` number in title it will match 1080 if added 1080 without spaces after it.

Filter Notes:
1. | means and.
2. Add `or` between similar keys, you can add it between qualities or between extensions, so don't add filter like this f: 1080|mp4 or 720|web because this will parse 1080 and (mp4 or 720) and web ... not (1080 and mp4) or (720 and web).
3. You can add `or` and `|` as much as you want.
4. Take a look at the title if it has a static special character after or before the qualities or extensions or whatever and use them in the filter to avoid wrong match.
